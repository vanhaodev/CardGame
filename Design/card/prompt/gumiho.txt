Fantasy splash art illustration for a trading card (1460x2048, vertical)

Style: painterly semi-realistic fantasy, soft moonlit lighting. Elegant, seductive, magical.

Subject: A stunning nine-tailed fox spirit woman with a smooth, hairless Asian angel face, sitting in a deep squatting pose, directly facing the viewer. She holds a pistol in her right hand and is wearing camouflage army boots. Her thighs are apart, hips slightly tilted back, and her arms resting loosely on her legs. This pose reveals her exposed lower belly and waist, with camouflage lace panties clearly visible beneath her short translucent garment. The posture is intimate, confident, and powerfully seductive.

Her skin is luminous porcelain-white with a silky, near-translucent texture. Soft glows ripple faintly under the moonlight, highlighting the smooth curves of her thighs, hips, stomach, chest, and collarbone. The surface of her skin gleams subtly — almost glasslike in reflective softness — yet retains warmth and realism. Light mist and floating particles gently scatter across her form, enhancing the supernatural, ethereal effect.

Her nine fox tails are pure white and fan out behind her in misty arcs, softly glowing. Each tail carries soft inner luminosity and hints of magical dust trailing from their motion.

Her face is that of a stunningly beautiful Asian angel, smooth and hairless, with soft, finely sculpted cheekbones and a refined jawline. Her skin remains smooth and glossy, with faint blush tones under the eyes and around the lips. Her slightly upturned almond eyes glow in deep amber-red, shimmering with emotion and divine energy. Her gaze is direct, piercing, and alluring — enhanced by fine eyelash detail, subtle reflection in the irises, and a light sheen across the lower lid. Her full lips are gently parted, with a moist sheen and a faint pink hue, forming a mysterious, gentle smile.

Long, flowing black hair cascades smoothly over her back and chest in delicate waves. The strands glisten faintly under the moonlight — some sections semi-transparent with blue and purple edge glows. Her white fox ears peek from her head, their fur soft and faintly glowing at the edges.

She wears a strapless, thin, post-apocalyptic, military-inspired top with a glossy finish and enhanced light reflection. The fabric is sheer and delicate, detailed with camouflage, and has hanbok-inspired details at the hem. The top reveals deep cleavage and the curves of her chest. The folds cling loosely to her figure, emphasizing volume and softness, while the transparency reveals the faint contours and curves beneath. Her breasts are full and prominent, and although her nipples are visible through the fabric, they are delicately covered by pleats and embroidery.

Below, she wears camouflage lace panties. Her thighs, bent deeply in the squat, appear plush, full, and glowing slightly under ambient moonlight. The squatting pose highlights the tension in her thighs and waistline, giving depth and realism to the anatomy.

Environment: She sits atop soft, mossy earth in the middle of a tranquil bamboo forest. It’s nighttime, and a glowing full moon shines down from above, casting silvery light through the canopy. Wisps of mist curl between the stalks, and luminous particles — like drifting pollen or embers — float gently through the air.

Color palette: deep midnight blue, silvery moonlight, soft blush pink, ivory white, gold accents.

Mood: dreamlike, seductive, and divine — a moment of supernatural intimacy, suspended in stillness.
